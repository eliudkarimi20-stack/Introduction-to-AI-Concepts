## Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that allows computers to learn from data and make decisions without being directly programmed for every task. Instead of writing exact instructions, we give the computer examples, and it learns patterns from that data.

There are three main types of machine learning:
- **Supervised Learning** – The computer learns from labeled examples (for example, spam vs. not spam emails).
- **Unsupervised Learning** – The computer finds patterns in data without labels.
- **Reinforcement Learning** – The computer learns by trying actions and receiving rewards or penalties.

Machine learning is used in many everyday applications such as:
- Netflix and YouTube recommendations
- Google search results
- Fraud detection in banking
- Voice assistants like Siri and Alexa
